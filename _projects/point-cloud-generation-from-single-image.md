layout: project 
year: experiment replication
project-url: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JBq1JZwtqurWaOkXqwNNRfjddVjmP7zi?usp=sharing
excerpt: Re-implemented the experiments done in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00603). The authors used a CNN based neural nets to predict the 3D point cloud of the given input (single) image.
