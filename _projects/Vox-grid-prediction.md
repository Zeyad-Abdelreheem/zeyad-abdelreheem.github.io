title: 3D-R2N2 A Unifed Approach for Single and Multi-view 3D Object Reconstruction
layout: project 
year: experiment replication
project-url: https://github.com/Zeyad-Abdelreheem/Awesome-3D-Vision-Notebooks/blob/main/3d-r2n2-vox-grid-prediction.ipynb
excerpt: Re-implemented the experiments done in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00449). The authors used CNN based encoder-decoder architecture with 3D-LSTM to construct the 3D voxel grid from a single/multiple image(s).
