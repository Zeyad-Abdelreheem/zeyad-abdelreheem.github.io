title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Spectral Efficiency Optimization and Mobility Management in Cellular Networks
year: 2024
excerpt: Submitted a paper during my MSc. degree on using reinforcement learning to optimize spectral efficiency and reduce handover rate achieving 20% increase in spectral efficiency and 10% reduction in handover rate. The paper is accepted and to be presented in December in the Internation Conference of Computer Application (ICCA). I will add the paper link once published.

Abstract — Optimizing the spectral efficiency of wireless networks
 has been a hot topic of research for decades. Various approaches
 have been separately proposed including power allocation and
 controlling handovers (mobility management). Each approach
 has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this work, two
 approaches are merged together (power control and mobility
 management) to optimize the spectral efficiency further while
 taking into consideration the negative side effect of the frequent
 handovers. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing a
 Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) to concurrently achieve two
 objectives. The proposed integrated model has demonstrated a
 significant improvement over baseline models that optimize both
 problems independently, resulting in a 20% decrease in handover
 rate and a 10% enhancement in spectral efficiency.
