title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Spectral Efficiency Optimization and Mobility Management in Cellular Networks
year: 2024
excerpt: Submitted a paper during my MSc. degree on using reinforcement learning to optimize spectral efficiency and reduce handover rate achieving 20% increase in spectral efficiency and 10% reduction in handover rate. The paper is accepted and to be presented in December in the Internation Conference of Computer Application (ICCA).
