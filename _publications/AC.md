title: Deep Learning based Admission Control in 5G networks
year: 2024
excerpt: Collaborated with Dell Technologies teams in Cairo and Canada to design and implement a deep neural network for admission control in 5G networks. The model dynamically decides whether to admit new UEs based on real-time network conditions, prioritizing QoS, specifically delay, for existing users. This research has been accepted for presentation at the [VTC](https://events.vtsociety.org/vtc2024-fall/) conference in Washington DC, October 2024. I will add a link to the paper once presented.
