title: Deep Learning based Multi-objective Admission Control A Novel O-RAN Compliant Approach
year: 2024
excerpt: Collaborated with Dell Technologies teams in Cairo and Canada to design and implement a deep neural network for admission control in 5G networks. The model dynamically decides whether to admit new UEs based on real-time network conditions, prioritizing QoS, specifically delay, for existing users. This research was accepted for presentation at the VTC conference in Washington DC, October 2024.
